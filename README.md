=======================

Between January and June 2013, Science contributing correspondent John Bohannon submitted 304 fake research papers to open access journals. The papers were designed with such grave scientific flaws that they should have been rejected immediately by editors and peer reviewers. This map shows which journals accepted or rejected the papers, along with the email correspondences that led to those outcomes. Using data from email IP addresses and bank invoices, it also compares the countries where publishers claim to be with the location of their editors and bank accounts--information that is frequently obscured by open access publishers.

This visualization was made by David Quinn and Daniel Wiesmann using [D3](http://d3js.org/), drawing on code from Derek Watkins [http://bl.ocks.org/dwtkns/4973620](http://bl.ocks.org/dwtkns/4973620). Download source

The code to make this visualization is listed here. We plan to tidy up the JavaScript!
The pdf papers are omitted from this repository as they are 0.5GB but they can be downloaded from the Science website.
